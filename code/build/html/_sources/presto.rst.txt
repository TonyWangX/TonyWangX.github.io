    **Unified Framework for Speech Privacy Protection and Fake Voice Detection**

    **プライバシー保護と偽音声検出を統合する音声データ処理基盤**

**Information**:

* PI: Xin Wang
* Period: 2023/10/01 - 2027/03/31
* Research area: `社会変革に向けたICT基盤強化 Strengthening ICT Infrastructure for Social Change <https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/presto/en/research_area/ongoing/area2021-3.html>`__

**Background**: The era of infodemics calls for a speech data processing system that can detect deepfake voices and anonymize speech privacy. However, existing fake voice detection and anonymization methods are independently designed, lacking joint optimization and theoretical support.

**Core ida**: This proposal tries to unify fake voice detection and voice anonymization within a deep learning framework based on likelihood ratios.
