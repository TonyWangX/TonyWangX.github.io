I am Xin Wang, a postdoc researcher at Yamagishi Lab, National Institute of Informatics (`NII <https://www.nii.ac.jp/>`_), Japan. 

I am studying speech processing and machine learning, and I learned a lot from my supervisors at NII and USTC and many colleagues around the world.

My `Researchmap site <https://researchmap.jp/wangxin?lang=en>`_ and `Google Scholar page <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMZhUHcAAAAJ&hl=en>`_. Researchmap is the official website for researchers in Japan to upload research outcomes.

Here is my :ref:`label-resume`.

       The materials for ICASSP short course on neural vocoders are available on `Google colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EO-ggi1U9f2zXwTiqg7AEljVx11JKta7>`_. The old contents are re-edited, and new contents are available (including NSF-HiFiGAN). 

*2022.01.04*

        Slides for JST Science Agora talk on speech spoofing detection is available: `PDF <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gf3zp00qvdp3row/AAC3cXcoPNA7M8MHB2CAXnY5a/web/Science-Agora-2021_part2.pdf>`_  and `PPT <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gf3zp00qvdp3row/AADLL5SEUSZ-fRPGSl_eiYRba/web/Science-Agora-2021_part2.pptx>`_. There are many spoofing audio samples under various conditions. You can try to detect which one is spoofed.
