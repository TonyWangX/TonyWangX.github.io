Welcome
*******
I am Xin Wang, a postdoc researcher at Yamagishi Lab, National Institute of Informatics (`NII <https://www.nii.ac.jp/>`_), Japan. 

I am studying speech processing and machine learning, and I learned a lot from my supervisors at NII and USTC and many colleagues around the world.

My `Researchmap site <https://researchmap.jp/wangxin?lang=en>`_ and `Google Scholar page <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMZhUHcAAAAJ&hl=en>`_. Researchmap is the official website for researchers in Japan to upload research outcomes.

Here is my :ref:`label-resume`.
