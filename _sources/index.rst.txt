I am Xin Wang, a postdoc researcher at `Yamagishi Lab <https://yamagishilab.jp/>`__, National Institute of Informatics (`NII <https://www.nii.ac.jp/>`__), Japan. I learned a lot from my supervisors at NII and USTC and many colleagues around the world.

My research interests include

* Speech information processing
  
* Speech synthesis
  
* Speech deepfake detection & anonymization

See more in my :ref:`label-resume`.
